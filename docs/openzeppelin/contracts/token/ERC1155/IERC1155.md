# Solidity API

## IERC1155

_Required interface of an ERC1155 compliant contract, as defined in the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155[EIP].

_Available since v3.1.__

### TransferSingle

```solidity
event TransferSingle(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 value)
```

_Emitted when &#x60;value&#x60; tokens of token type &#x60;id&#x60; are transferred from &#x60;from&#x60; to &#x60;to&#x60; by &#x60;operator&#x60;._

### TransferBatch

```solidity
event TransferBatch(address operator, address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values)
```

_Equivalent to multiple {TransferSingle} events, where &#x60;operator&#x60;, &#x60;from&#x60; and &#x60;to&#x60; are the same for all
transfers._

### ApprovalForAll

```solidity
event ApprovalForAll(address account, address operator, bool approved)
```

_Emitted when &#x60;account&#x60; grants or revokes permission to &#x60;operator&#x60; to transfer their tokens, according to
&#x60;approved&#x60;._

### URI

```solidity
event URI(string value, uint256 id)
```

_Emitted when the URI for token type &#x60;id&#x60; changes to &#x60;value&#x60;, if it is a non-programmatic URI.

If an {URI} event was emitted for &#x60;id&#x60;, the standard
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata-extensions[guarantees] that &#x60;value&#x60; will equal the value
returned by {IERC1155MetadataURI-uri}._

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256)
```

_Returns the amount of tokens of token type &#x60;id&#x60; owned by &#x60;account&#x60;.

Requirements:

- &#x60;account&#x60; cannot be the zero address._

### balanceOfBatch

```solidity
function balanceOfBatch(address[] accounts, uint256[] ids) external view returns (uint256[])
```

_xref:ROOT:erc1155.adoc#batch-operations[Batched] version of {balanceOf}.

Requirements:

- &#x60;accounts&#x60; and &#x60;ids&#x60; must have the same length._

### setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external
```

_Grants or revokes permission to &#x60;operator&#x60; to transfer the caller&#x27;s tokens, according to &#x60;approved&#x60;,

Emits an {ApprovalForAll} event.

Requirements:

- &#x60;operator&#x60; cannot be the caller._

### isApprovedForAll

```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) external view returns (bool)
```

_Returns true if &#x60;operator&#x60; is approved to transfer &#x60;&#x60;account&#x60;&#x60;&#x27;s tokens.

See {setApprovalForAll}._

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data) external
```

_Transfers &#x60;amount&#x60; tokens of token type &#x60;id&#x60; from &#x60;from&#x60; to &#x60;to&#x60;.

Emits a {TransferSingle} event.

Requirements:

- &#x60;to&#x60; cannot be the zero address.
- If the caller is not &#x60;from&#x60;, it must be have been approved to spend &#x60;&#x60;from&#x60;&#x60;&#x27;s tokens via {setApprovalForAll}.
- &#x60;from&#x60; must have a balance of tokens of type &#x60;id&#x60; of at least &#x60;amount&#x60;.
- If &#x60;to&#x60; refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155Received} and return the
acceptance magic value._

### safeBatchTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data) external
```

_xref:ROOT:erc1155.adoc#batch-operations[Batched] version of {safeTransferFrom}.

Emits a {TransferBatch} event.

Requirements:

- &#x60;ids&#x60; and &#x60;amounts&#x60; must have the same length.
- If &#x60;to&#x60; refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155BatchReceived} and return the
acceptance magic value._
