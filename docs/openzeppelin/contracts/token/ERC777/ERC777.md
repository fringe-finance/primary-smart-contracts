## ERC777

_Implementation of the {IERC777} interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both
the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token
movements.

Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to &#x60;1&#x60;, meaning that there
are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless._

themselves._

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address holder, address recipient, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Note that operator and allowance concepts are orthogonal: operators cannot
call &#x60;transferFrom&#x60; (unless they have allowance), and accounts with
allowance cannot call &#x60;operatorSend&#x60; (unless they are operators).

Emits {Sent}, {IERC20-Transfer} and {IERC20-Approval} events._

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) internal virtual

the total supply.

If a send hook is registered for &#x60;account&#x60;, the corresponding function
will be called with &#x60;operator&#x60;, &#x60;data&#x60; and &#x60;operatorData&#x60;.

See {IERC777Sender} and {IERC777Recipient}.

Emits {Minted} and {IERC20-Transfer} events.

Requirements

- &#x60;account&#x60; cannot be the zero address.
- if &#x60;account&#x60; is a contract, it must implement the {IERC777Recipient}
interface._

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData, bool requireReceptionAck) internal virtual
```

_Creates &#x60;amount&#x60; tokens and assigns them to &#x60;account&#x60;, increasing
the total supply.

If &#x60;requireReceptionAck&#x60; is set to true, and if a send hook is
registered for &#x60;account&#x60;, the corresponding function will be called with
&#x60;operator&#x60;, &#x60;data&#x60; and &#x60;operatorData&#x60;.

See {IERC777Sender} and {IERC777Recipient}.

Emits {Minted} and {IERC20-Transfer} events.
