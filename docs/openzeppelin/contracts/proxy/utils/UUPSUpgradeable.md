# UUPSUpgradeable







*An upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies. The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy. A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing `UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades. The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism. _Available since v4.1._*

## Methods

### upgradeTo

```solidity
function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external nonpayable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |

### upgradeToAndCall

```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes data) external payable
```



*Upgrade the implementation of the proxy to `newImplementation`, and subsequently execute the function call encoded in `data`. Calls {_authorizeUpgrade}. Emits an {Upgraded} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| newImplementation | address | undefined |
| data | bytes | undefined |
